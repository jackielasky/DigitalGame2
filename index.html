<h2>The Watering Hole</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The ranger is setting off for a big journey through Africa and needs to collect as much water as he can before embarking on his journey; only problem is the watering hole is guarded by the animals, who if he comes into contact with, he dies.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to feel a little bit of relaxation from the falling rain and the calming colors, but also some anxiety as they complete the task.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The genre is animals and arcade.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
It is evaluating timing, stratedgy, and concentration.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It has a different type of gravity that centers around a center-point instead of the ground being the gravity in the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is more abstract, so the player will have to bring in their imagineation to combine with the concepts and assets to create a better understanding of the environment. The world is set in the African safari and the animals are true to the location. The "watering hole" is represented by a bucket of water, and the animals are all guarding it from the ranger, who needs the water to survive.    
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The ranger is in need of collecting water for his future journey (potentially going to create more levels following this one), the more water he collects the better off he will be to surive the summer heat. Unfortunately the watering hole is guarded by some friendly and some dangerous animals of Africa.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game targets a younger crowd that likes animals.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
2-3 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Concentration and patience.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the animals using paint and the black ball they orbit with paint as well.
